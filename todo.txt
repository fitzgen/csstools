UI Issues
=========

From doctor.html:

* Make the answerView wider, and overflow from the blank128 borders
  * This should get rid of a thin white line rendering bug
* Re-open to last position
* Animate the open/close action - slide actions
* Re-create blank128 in CSS or at least have higher res image
  * Reduce the top border?
* On open, close the other things at a similar level

The idea is that the icon is the minimized file which expands, so it shouldn't
be 'there' when expanded, but this isn't working just right now.

* Try putting icons on right hand side (probably lined up in a table?)

From OverflowPanelHost:

* Can we make the blur background work?
* Add close button to toolbar (unimportant)
* Make all bits of background close the dialog
* Maybe we should emulate FF4's popup dialogs?


Notes on the SDK
================
It seems legitimate to want to share copies of surrogate.js.
- Isn't how addon authors lay out their files, their business?


Checks the Doctor will need to make
===================================
- Is the rule in a sheet that is disabled
- Is the rule in a sheet excluded by it's media type?
